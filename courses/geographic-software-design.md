# Geographic Software Design

Welcome to the official course website for _**Geographic Software Design**_, offered by the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This course provides an immersive journey into the world of developing open-source Python packages for geospatial analysis and interactive mapping.

## Course Overview

This course offers a comprehensive introduction to creating and designing open-source Python packages for geospatial analysis and interactive mapping. Students will gain hands-on experience with popular Python development environments, including Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Colab, to streamline the development, packaging, and distribution of their code. The course emphasizes leveraging existing geospatial libraries, such as [geemap](https://geemap.org) and [leafmap](https://leafmap.org), as models for best practices, while fostering contributions to the open-source community.

Throughout the course, students will learn how to design a fully functional Python package, complete with an accompanying documentation website that can be freely hosted on GitHub. The curriculum includes essential topics such as version control with Git, writing clean and reusable code, generating documentation, and sharing projects with collaborators and the broader Python ecosystem.

By the end of the course, students will have developed their own Python package, gaining practical skills highly valued in technical roles such as GIS analyst, data scientist, and software developer. These skills will not only enhance their resumes but also position them competitively in the job market for cutting-edge geospatial and software development roles.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successfully completing the course, students will be able to:

- Apply git for effective version control
