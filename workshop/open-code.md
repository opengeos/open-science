$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Initialize a Git repository
$ git init

# Check repository status
$ git status

# Add files to staging area
$ git add filename

# Commit changes
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"

# View commit history
$ git log
```

## 3. Introduction to GitHub

### Setting Up GitHub

- Create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/)

### Creating a Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/), click on _New Repository_.
2. Name the repository and select visibility (public/private).
3. Initialize with a README (optional).

### Connecting Local Repository to GitHub

```sh
# Clone a repository from GitHub
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

## 4. Introduction to VS Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a free, cross-platform source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Itâ€™s lightweight, highly customizable, and packed with features to make coding efficient and enjoyable. Key features include:

- **Debugging**: Identify and fix issues in your code directly within the editor.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Make your code easier to read and understand.
- **Intelligent Code Completion**: Get smart suggestions based on your code.
- **Snippets**: Quickly insert reusable pieces of code.
- **Code Refactoring**: Simplify and restructure your code efficiently.
- **Built-in Git Integration**: Manage version control seamlessly within the editor.

VS Code also supports an extensive library of **extensions** to enhance functionality, allowing you to tailor the editor to meet your specific needs.

### Installation

1. **Download and Install**: Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.
2. **Launch VS Code**: After installation, open Visual Studio Code.
3. **Verify Installation**: Ensure that VS Code is installed correctly by checking the version. Open the terminal or command prompt and type `code --version`. You should see the installed version number.

## 6. Introduction to uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust. For packages that can be installed from PyPI, `uv` is a great alternative to `pip`. To install `uv`, follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install uv on your system.

Once installed, you can use `uv` to create a new environment and install packages as follows:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project
uv venv
uv venv --python 3.12
uv pip install jupyterlab leafmap
uv run jupyter lab
```

## 7. Collaborative Workflows

### Forking and Pull Requests

- **Forking**: Create your own copy of a repository to work on.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: Propose changes to the original repository.

### Steps for Contributing

1. **Fork a repository**
2. **Clone your fork using VS Code**
3. **Create a new branch**
   ```sh
   $ git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
4. **Make changes and commit**
   ```sh
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "Added a new feature"
   ```
5. **Push to your fork**
   ```sh
   $ git push origin feature-branch
   ```
6. **Create a Pull Request on GitHub**

## 8. Best Practices for Open Code

- Use **meaningful commit messages**.
- Write **clear documentation** (README, comments, inline explanations).
