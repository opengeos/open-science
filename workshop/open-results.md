# Open Results

## Workshop Description

Open results refer to the practice of making research findings openly available, ensuring transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in science. This workshop introduces participants to principles and practical approaches for sharing research results using computational notebooks and documentation tools. Participants will learn how to use Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, MkDocs, and Zenodo to document, share, and publish their findings effectively.

This session is ideal for researchers, educators, and students looking to improve the accessibility and impact of their research. No prior experience with these tools is required, making it accessible to beginners.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

- Understand the significance of open results in research.
- Use Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab to create and share computational research.
- Utilize MkDocs to document and publish research findings.
- Use Zenodo to store and archive research outputs with DOIs.
- Implement best practices for open-access publishing and licensing.
- Use structured metadata to improve the discoverability of research outputs.

## 1. Introduction to Open Results

### Why Open Results?

- **Transparency**: Ensures research credibility and accountability.
- **Reproducibility**: Allows verification and validation of findings.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates interdisciplinary teamwork.
- **Impact**: Increases visibility and citation potential.

### Tools for Open Results Sharing

- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source tool for interactive computational research.
- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment for sharing and executing code.
- **MkDocs**: A static site generator for publishing research documentation.
- **Zenodo**: A general-purpose open-access repository for sharing and preserving research outputs.

## 2. Hands-on: Sharing Computational Research and Findings

### Using Google Colab for Open Research

1. Open Google Colab and create a new notebook.
2. Write code, equations, and narrative text in Markdown.
3. Upload datasets and execute code interactively.
4. Share the notebook publicly using the **Share** button.
5. Export the notebook as HTML or PDF for publication.

### Publishing Results with Jupyter Notebook

1. Create a Jupyter Notebook on a local or cloud environment.
2. Document research workflows with Markdown cells and interactive code.
3. Export notebooks in `.ipynb` or `.html` format for sharing.
4. Upload the notebook to a repository or hosting platform.

### Using MkDocs for Research Documentation

1. Install MkDocs (`pip install mkdocs`).
2. Create a new documentation project (`mkdocs new mydocs`).
3. Write research documentation using Markdown.
4. Build and serve the site locally (`mkdocs serve`).
5. Deploy documentation online using GitHub Pages or another hosting service.

### Archiving and Sharing Research on Zenodo

1. Log in to Zenodo and create a new upload.
2. Fill in metadata fields (title, description, keywords, funding, etc.).
3. Upload research outputs (Jupyter notebooks, datasets, documentation files).
4. Choose a license (e.g., CC-BY) and generate a DOI.
5. Publish and share the link to increase visibility.

## 3. Best Practices for Open Results Sharing

### Maximizing Research Visibility

- Use keywords and structured metadata for discoverability.
- Link publications, datasets, and code repositories.
- Share research on social media and institutional channels.

### Licensing and Attribution

- Use open-access licenses such as **CC-BY**.
- Clearly state reuse terms and provide proper citations.

### Ensuring Research Integrity

- Disclose methods and data used in analyses.
- Provide version history and updates where applicable.
- Follow best practices for documentation and reproducibility.
